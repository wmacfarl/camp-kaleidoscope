      <h1>Our Program</h1>
      <p>
        Camp Kaleidoscope is a two-week summer camp for kids ages 6–12. We
        combine play, arts, making, and self-directed learning to spark
        creativity and confidence.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Schedule</h2>
      <p>
        9:00am–3:00pm Monday–Friday, plus optional early/late care. Activities
        include hands-on projects, free-build time, outdoor play, and creative
        group endeavors.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Week 1: July 7–11</li>
        <li>Week 2: July 14–18</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Camp Day</h2>
      `
      <p>
        We split the day into a morning and afternoon activity period. At the
        beginning of the day, and after lunch, we gather to hold a brief
        meeting, where campers and staff can check in with each other, share
        ideas, be together, and plan the day. Each day staff come prepared with
        activities and projects that they are excited about sharing but we also
        leave space for campers to share their own ideas and interests. After
        meeting kids are free to join projects, organize their own activities,
        or just hang out and play.
      </p>
      <p>
        At any given moment, campers might be playing board games, making
        puppets, programming computers, playing with bubbles, or running around
        outside. Some kids will spend all day or week working on a single
        project while others will move from one activity to another.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        We believe kids thrive when given the tools, ideas, independence, and
        support to invent and create on their own terms.
      </p>
