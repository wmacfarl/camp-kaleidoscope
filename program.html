      <h1>Our Program</h1>
      <p>
        Camp Kaleidoscope is a two-week summer camp for kids ages 6–12. We
        combine play, arts, making, and self-directed learning to spark
        creativity and confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our program will be very small this summer -- 8-12 kids and two staff
        members plus a rotating cast of guest artists and facilitators who will
        join us for a day or two to share the things they are excited about.
        This small size and very low camper-to-staff ratio helps us create a
        personalized, supportive, and fun environment for kids with a lot of
        free space for improvisation and exploration throughout the week.
      </p>
      <h1>Our Schedule</h1>
      <p>
        9:00am–3:00pm Monday–Friday, plus optional early/late care. Activities
        include hands-on arts and making projects, free-build time, outdoor
        play, and creative group endeavors.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Week 1: July 7–11</li>
        <li>Week 2: July 14–18</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>The Camp Day</h1>
      `
      <p>
        We split the day into a morning and afternoon activity period. At the
        beginning of the day, and after lunch, we gather to hold a brief
        meeting, where campers and staff can check in with each other, share
        ideas, be together, and plan the day. Each day staff come prepared with
        activities and projects that they are excited about sharing but we also
        leave space for campers to share their own ideas and interests. After
        meeting kids are free to join projects, organize their own activities,
        or just hang out and play.
      </p>
      <p>
        At any given moment, campers might be playing board games, making
        puppets, programming computers, playing with bubbles, or running around
        outside. Some kids will spend all day or week working on a single
        project while others will move from one activity to another.
      </p>

      <h1>A Place to Be</h1>
      <p>
        Everyone deserves a space where they can be themselves, as individuals,
        and feel connected to a caring, supportive, and creative community. We
        are committed to fostering an environment where all campers can thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Day to day life for children in the 21st century is often overscheduled,
        overstructured, and overly focused on performance. The primary project
        that kids need to be working on is learning about and becoming who they
        are. Our job as grownups is to create an environment and community that
        supports that process.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe kids thrive when given the tools, ideas, independence, and
        support to invent and create on their own terms.
      </p>
      <h1>Crafting Community</h1>
      <p>
        Camp Kaleidoscope is a
        <a href="/inclusivity.html">radically inclusive</a> space for all kids.
        We are committed to creating a safe, welcoming, and supportive
        environment for all campers. We believe that everyone should feel free
        to be themselves and express their identities.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that art, engineering, building, making, and play are all
        essential and deeply personal forms of creativity and expression and
        that kids and adults both thrive in communities of creative practice.
      </p>
