      <h1>Sliding Scale</h1>
      <p>
        Camp Kaleidoscope is committed to making our program accessible to all
        families, regardless of income. We are offering a sliding scale for
        registration fees, with a suggested fee of $350 per week.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you register for camp you will be asked to select a fee from the
        sliding scale. There is no application process, you just pay what you
        can. We encourage families to pay what makes sense for them for each
        week of camp.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand that all families have different financial situations, and
        that some families may be able to pay more or less than the suggested
        fee. We encourage families to pay what makes sense for them for each
        week of camp.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are unable to pay the suggested fee, that is okay! We are happy
        to offer free and reduced cost slots to families who need them. On the
        contrary, if you are able to pay more than the suggested fee, additional
        funds will help us offer free and reduced cost slots to families who
        need them and fund ongoing programming.
