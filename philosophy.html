      <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Learning by Doing</h2>
        <p>
          Humans learn best when they are making things and making things
          happen. We believe that art, engineering, building, making, and play
          are all essential and deeply personal forms of creativity and
          expression and that kids and adults both thrive in communities of
          creative practice.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Identity &amp; Belonging</h2>
        <p>
          Creativity flourishes in a space where you can be fully yourself. We
          are a queer-friendly, trans-inclusive, anti-racist community. We
          celebrate all identities and experiences, and we work to make our camp
          a safe and welcoming space for all.
        </p>

        <h2>Sliding Scale</h2>
        <p>
          Access matters. Choose the price that fits—no paperwork, no questions.
          If you can contribute more, you help fund spots for families who need
          it; if less, that’s okay too.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>A Place to Be</h2>
        <p>
          Day to day life for children in the 21st century is often
          overscheduled, overstructured, and overly focused on performance. The
          primary project that kids need to be working on is learning about and
          becoming who they are. Our job as grownups is to create an environment
          and community that supports that process.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are all at our most-alive when we chase our curiosities. We provide
          tools, ideas, and guidance, then step back so campers can steer.
        </p>

        <h2>Other Writing</h2>
        <p>
          In the course of our work we have written a number of essays and given
          presentations elaborating on our philosophy and style of teaching and
          learning. Here are a few links to those:
