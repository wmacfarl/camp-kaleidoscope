      <h1>Meet Our Team</h1>
      <p>
        Camp Kaleidoscope is run by a small team of experienced educators and
        artists. We are committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and fun
        environment for all campers.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this is the first summer of Camp Kaleidoscope in Providence, we
        have many decades of combined experience in summer camp, education, and
        the arts.
      </p>

        Michael and Will ran a program called Camp Kaleidoscope in Cambridge, MA
        for 4 years. This program grew into
        <a href="https://www.partsandcrafts.info/">Parts and Crafts</a> -- a
        community makerspace in Somerville, MA that Will and Katie co-directed
        for 10 years before moving to Providence together.

        <h2>Will Macfarlane</h2>
        <p>
          During the rest of the year, Will makes tools for creative learning at
          <a href="https://joylabz.com/">JoyLabz</a>. Before moving to
          Providence he founded co-directed
          <a href="https://www.partsandcrafts.info/">Parts and Crafts</a> with
          Katie Gradowski. He is also a dad to a 6-year-old who is extremely
          excited about camp this summer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Will likes to teach kids how to use tools, program computers, make
          simple electronics and big cardboard contraptions. His favorite tool
          is the hot glue gun and he loves to run around outside and play games.

        <h2>Michael Nagle</h2>
        <p>
          Michael got deeply interested in learning after becoming disillusioned
          with my math education at MIT. This led to a period of learning and
          visiting several alternative models of schooling as well as being
          influenced by the Lifelong Kindergarden group's work on using a
          computer as a creative sandbox and feedback rich environment. Out of
          that work came Camp Kaleidoscope, which ran for its first summer in
          Cambridge in 2006.
        </p>
        <p>
          Michael is deeply interested in learning, psychology, spirituality,
          mathematics, and lately - by virtue of having a stage 4 cancer
          diagnosis - functional medicine and systems biology. Reviving Camp is
          a wish on his bucket list - to make sure this precious creative work
          has a happy and healthy home that can outlive him and support
          generations of kids in exploring their own versions of creative
          autonomy and social belonging.

        <h2>Katie Gradowski</h2>
        <p>
          Katie loves telling stories, making beautiful things out of popsicle
          sticks, crafting, exploring, and making new friends. She is a lawyer
          by day and is thrilled about setting the briefs aside and jumping back
          into the education space with Kaleidoscope for a few weeks this
          summer.
