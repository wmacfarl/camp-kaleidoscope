      <h1>Meet Our Team</h1>
      <p>
        Camp Kaleidoscope is run by a small team of experienced educators and
        artists. We are committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and fun
        environment for all campers.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this is the first summer of Camp Kaleidoscope in Providence, we
        have many decades of combined experience in summer camp, education, and
        the arts.

        Michael and Will ran a program called Camp Kaleidoscope in Cambridge, MA
        for 4 years. This program grew into
        <a href="https://www.partsandcrafts.info/">Parts and Crafts</a> -- a
        community makerspace in Somerville, MA that Will and Katie co-directed
        for 10 years before moving to Providence together.

          During the rest of the year, Will makes tools for creative learning at
          <a href="https://joylabz.com/">JoyLabz</a>. Before moving to
          Providence he founded co-directed
          <a href="https://www.partsandcrafts.info/">Parts and Crafts</a> with
          Katie Gradowski. He is also a dad to a 6-year-old who is extremely
          excited about camp this summer.

          Will likes to teach kids how to use tools, program computers, make
          simple electronics and big cardboard contraptions. His favorite tool
          is the hot glue gun and he loves to run around outside and play games.
