      <h1>"Radically Inclusive"</h1>
      <p>
        It's easy to get lost in the minutia of language around inclusivity, and
        it's very hard to center any particular groups or needs in a single
        phrase without implicitly decentering others.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, in this world, and especially right now when the
        existence of systemic oppression is being called into question by our
        federal government, when queer and trans kids and families are
        explicitly under attack, and when the apparatus of power in this country
        is being used to actively support white supremacy and the idea of the
        United States as an ethnically-white nation, we need to be explicit
        about our values and insist on their importance.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are flawed humans in a racist society running a summer camp for kids
        on unceded Narragansett land, but we are committed to being a radically
        inclusive space for all kids and families, regardless of their
        background or identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing is more important than having a space where you can be yourself,
        feel like you belong, and be free to explore your identity. In the end,
        our commitment to inclusivity is not a different value from our
        commitment to creativity, self-expression, autonomy, and play. We are
        committed to creating a space where all kids can be themselves, and we
        are committed to making that space safe and welcoming for all kids and
        families.
