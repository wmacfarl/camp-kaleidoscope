          <h3>Will Macfarlane</h3>
          <p>
            During the rest of the year, Will makes tools for creative learning
            at
            <a href="https://joylabz.com/">JoyLabz</a>. Before moving to
            Providence he co-founded and co-directed
            <a href="https://www.partsandcrafts.info/">Parts and Crafts</a> with
            Katie Gradowski. He is also a dad to a 6-year-old who is extremely
            excited about camp this summer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Will likes to teach kids how to use tools, program computers, make
            simple electronics and big cardboard contraptions. His favorite tool
            is the hot-glue gun and he loves to run around outside and play
            games.

          <h3>Michael Nagle</h3>
          <p>
            Michael became deeply interested in learning after feeling
            disillusioned with his math education at MIT. This led to visiting
            alternative models of schooling and drawing inspiration from the
            Lifelong Kindergarten group’s work on computers as creative
            sandboxes. Out of that exploration came the first Camp Kaleidoscope
            in Cambridge in 2006.
          </p>
          <p>
            Michael is fascinated by learning, psychology, spirituality, and
            mathematics. Since receiving a stage-4 cancer diagnosis he has also
            delved into functional medicine and systems biology. Reviving Camp
            is on his bucket list—to give this creative work a happy, healthy
            home that can outlive him and support generations of kids in
            exploring their own versions of creative autonomy and social
            belonging.

          <h3>Katie Gradowski</h3>
          <p>
            Katie loves telling stories, making beautiful things out of popsicle
            sticks, crafting, exploring, and making new friends. She is a lawyer
            by day and is thrilled to set the briefs aside and jump back into
            the education space with Kaleidoscope for a few weeks this summer.
